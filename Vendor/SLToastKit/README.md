SLToastKit
=============
Created by Gregory S. Combs.
Based on work at [GitHub](https://github.com/grgcombs/SLToastKit).

Description
=============

- This is an iOS framework that presents "toast"-like notifications to the user.  Inspired by previous endeavors like [MTInfoPanel](https://github.com/myell0w/MTInfoPanel), where SLToastKit differs is in the application of a FIFO queue for holding multiple notifications (or "*toasts*") in ordered stasis, until it's turn for presentation from the queue.
